A Netflix clone made in React with Tailwind CSS and Google's Firebase Authentication. As an added bonus, OpenAI's GPT-3 has been integrated into the app for super-powers.

## How to run?

I have hosted the app. Check the link in the description of the repo. However, if you want to clone it, simply fire up a terminal and run <code>npm i</code>.

</ol>
